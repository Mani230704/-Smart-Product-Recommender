## üé® Summary of My Approach
The Smart Product Recommender leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to deliver personalized experiences:

Data Management: Loads initial product data into a Pandas DataFrame, supports dynamic additions, and indexes data in a ChromaDB vector database for efficient searches.
Recommendation Engine: Uses SentenceTransformer embeddings and WordNet synonyms to match queries, with sorting by relevance, price, or sentiment, enhanced by category and review weights.
User Interaction: Tracks views, feedback, and favorites via session state, offering features like search, comparison, product addition, favorites, and performance metrics.
UI Design: Features a responsive, card-based interface with custom CSS, light/dark theme toggling, and pagination for a seamless experience.
Extensibility: Enables real-time updates by refreshing the vector database and provides CSV exports for recommendations and the product database.


## üìã Assumptions Made

Data Availability: Assumes sufficient initial data with valid image URLs and consistent schema for testing.
User Behavior: Assumes consistent user interactions to build meaningful preference patterns; limited historical data may reduce accuracy.
Network Access: Requires internet for loading external images and embedding models; offline use is not supported.
Performance: Assumes local machine handles ChromaDB and embedding computations; no high-load optimizations.
Input Validation: Assumes reasonable user inputs (e.g., non-negative prices) with basic error handling.
Review Authenticity: Relies on heuristic rules (e.g., short length, excessive exclamation marks) to detect inauthentic reviews.


## üß™ Basic Test Coverage for Key Endpoints
Test the core functionalities with this script. Save as test_app.py:
pythonimport unittest
import pandas as pd
from app import DataLoader, ReviewAuthenticity, QueryExpander, VectorDB, RecommendationEngine

class TestProductRecommender(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.df = DataLoader.load_initial_product_data()
        self.vector_db = VectorDB()
        self.vector_db.add_products(self.df)
        self.recommender = RecommendationEngine(self.vector_db)

    def test_data_loading(self):
        df = DataLoader.load_product_data()
        self.assertFalse(df.empty)
        self.assertEqual(len(df), 4)

    def test_review_authenticity(self):
        review = "Great product!!! Buy now!!!"
        score = ReviewAuthenticity.score_review(review)
        self.assertLess(score, 0.4)
        
        review = "Good quality, reliable."
        score = ReviewAuthenticity.score_review(review)
        self.assertGreaterEqual(score, 0.5)

    def test_query_expansion(self):
        query = "wireless headphones"
        expanded = QueryExpander.expand_query(query)
        self.assertTrue(len(expanded.split()) > 2)  # Should include synonyms

    def test_recommendations(self):
        recommendations, _ = self.recommender.get_recommendations(
            "headphones", ["Electronics"], 0.0, 200.0, "relevance", 2
        )
        self.assertGreaterEqual(len(recommendations), 1)
        self.assertIn("Wireless Headphones Pro", [r['name'] for r in recommendations])

    def test_cross_category_recommendations(self):
        cross_recs = self.recommender.get_cross_category_recommendations("1", 0.0, 200.0, 2)
        self.assertGreaterEqual(len(cross_recs), 1)
        self.assertNotIn("Electronics", [r['category'] for r in cross_recs])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
Run Tests
bashpython -m unittest test_app.py
